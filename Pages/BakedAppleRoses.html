            <strong id="Description" class="Ingredients">INGREDIENTS</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>1 large red apple, cored and very thinly sliced</li>
                <li>One fourth cup white sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
                <li>One fourth cup melted butter</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons water</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon confectioners' sugar (Optional)</li>
            </ul>

            <strong id="Description">STEPS</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Adjust an oven rack to the middle position. Butter two (6 to 8-ounce) ramekins and dust with white sugar.</li>
                <li>Place apple slices on a microwave-safe plate, overlapping slightly if necessary. Microwave on high until slices slightly soften, about 45 seconds. Cover the plate with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel.</li>
                <li>Mix together sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl.</li>
                <li>Roll puff pastry sheet to less than 1/8-inch thickness. Using a pizza cutter, cut two (3x12-inch) rectangles. Reserve remaining pieces for another use.</li>
                <li>Spread melted butter over dough; sprinkle with a generous amount of cinnamon sugar. Place apple slices along one long edge of dough, about 1/4 inch beyond the edge, overlapping slices slightly. Fold the bottom half of dough over apple slices to form a long "folder" of dough with rounded edges of apple slices exposed.</li>
                <li>Bake</li>
            </ol>
